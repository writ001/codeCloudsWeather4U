# codeCloudsWeather4U
The Assignment was about creating a weather forecast portal where the location was getting tracked based on the geolocation of the user. This app also have a feature of getting weather reports of other cities through out the world. The filter for hourly and daily weather reports have also been taken care. I have used reactjs,redux,bootstrap,css to complete this assignment.
Please Note: Implementation in docker and UI testing are not there in this assignment as I dont have deep knowledge in these but I will be starting to learn these as this are interesting and important.
